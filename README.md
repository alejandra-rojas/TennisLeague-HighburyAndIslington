User-friendly web application designed to streamline the creation, organization, and management of the internal competitions of a tennis club, while presenting the results to the public through a modern and responsive website. The admin tool simplifies the entire league management process, from setting up a league to adding players and effortlessly updating scores that keep in sync with the public frontend. 

The project originated from the need of the Highbury and Islington Tennis Club to simplify the management of their leagues, which involved maintaining the league data manually on an Excel spreadsheet. With every score report, there would be a manual update followed by a screenshot upload to the existing website to display the updated scores. This webapp greatly improves the workflow, making league management more efficient and accessible.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** Developed with Next.js, making use of Zustand for state management. GSAP/Framer Motion for dynamic animations and SCSS for styling.

- **Database:** Employing Supabase with Postgres integration, allowing for cost-effective deployment on Vercel.
- **RESTful API:** Supabase.js and React Query for a RESTful API implementation, providing seamless communication between the frontend and the database.
