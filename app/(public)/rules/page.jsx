      <h2>DOUBLES LEAGUE RULES </h2>
      <p>
        â€‹The current league runs from Monday 7th August 2023 to Monday 29th
        January 2024. <br />
        Halfway point: Monday 6th November 2023
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each pair plays all other pairs in their division. Each pair is
          responsible for organising their own matches, agreeing dates with
          opponents, booking courts etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Best of 3 tiebreak sets. If time is short and both pairs agree, a
          championship tiebreak (first to 10, 2 points ahead) can be played
          instead of a 3rd set.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">AWARDED POINTS. </span>
          Two points per set & only completed sets count. If a match is
          unfinished only the completed sets will score and, if possible,
          another time should be arranged to finish the match.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">MATCH REPORTS. </span>
          Winners to email the results to HTCdoublesleagues@gmail.com and the
          scores will be entered on this website. Please email the scores even
          if the match is unfinished.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">BONUS POINTS. </span>
          An extra point is awarded if three matches (four matches if you are in
          Division 3 or 4) against pairs in your division are completed by the
          mid-way date and another point is awarded if you complete all matches
          in your division by the end date. Only completed matches count.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">CHALLENGER MATCHES. </span>
          It is possible to gain extra points by challenging pairs in the
          Division above to a match. Pairs in Division 1 can challenge pairs in
          Division 2. A point will be awarded to both the challengers and the
          challenged if a match goes ahead AND IS COMPLETED. The points won for
          sets will be 2 points per set for the pair in the lower division and 1
          point per set for the pair in the higher division. If challenged, you
          do not have to accept.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">INJURIES. </span>
          If a player is injured during play and unable to continue the match,
          they will concede that match and the points from the uncompleted set/s
          go to the other pair.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">WITHDRAWALS. </span>
          If a pair has to withdraw from the league, all points won in matches
          against that pair will be deducted. Points awarded for completing
          three (or four) matches by 6th November will not be affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">WINNERS. </span>
          If there is a tie for top place at the end, set points are worth more
          than points earned for playing matches. If there is still a tie, the
          prize goes to the pair who won the match between the pairs concerned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="bold">PRIZE. </span>
          The prize for the winning pair in each division is a can of balls per
          player.
