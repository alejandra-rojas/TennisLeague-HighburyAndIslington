      DOUBLES LEAGUE INSTRUCTIONS & RULES ​ ​The league runs from Monday 7th
      August 2023 to Monday 29th January 2024. Halfway point: Monday 6th
      November 2023. Each pair plays all other pairs in their division. Each
      pair is responsible for organising their own matches, agreeing dates with
      opponents, booking courts etc. Best of 3 tiebreak sets. If time is short
      and both pairs agree, a championship tiebreak (first to 10, 2 points
      ahead) can be played instead of a 3rd set. Two points per set & only
      completed sets count. If a match is unfinished only the completed sets
      will score and, if possible, another time should be arranged to finish the
      match. Winners to email the results to HTCdoublesleagues@gmail.com and the
      scores will be entered on this website. Please email the scores even if
      the match is unfinished. An extra point is awarded if three matches (four
      matches if you are in Division 3 or 4) against pairs in your division are
      completed by the mid-way date and another point is awarded if you complete
      all matches in your division by the end date. Only completed matches
      count. It is possible to gain extra points by challenging pairs in the
      Division above to a match. Pairs in Division 1 can challenge pairs in
      Division 2. A point will be awarded to both the challengers and the
      challenged if a match goes ahead AND IS COMPLETED. The points won for sets
      will be 2 points per set for the pair in the lower division and 1 point
      per set for the pair in the higher division. If challenged, you do not
      have to accept. If a pair has to withdraw from the league, all points won
      in matches against that pair will be deducted. Points awarded for
      completing three (or four) matches by 6th November will not be affected.
      If there is a tie for top place at the end, set points are worth more than
      points earned for playing matches. If there is still a tie, the prize goes
      to the pair who won the match between the pairs concerned. If a player is
      injured during play and unable to continue the match, they will concede
      that match and the points from the uncompleted set/s go to the other pair.
      The prize for the winning pair in each division is a can of balls per
      player.
